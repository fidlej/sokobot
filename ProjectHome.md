This project experiments how to solve Sokoban-like mazes effectively.
How is it possible to reduce the search space? Why should be humans better at puzzle tasks?

Techniques to explore:
  * Prunning
  * Heuristics
  * Dynamic programming
  * Aggregation
  * Abstraction
  * Decomposition
  * Knowledge database (pattern database, endgame database)
  * Reformulation to get better actions
  * Reformulation to get less states
  * Reformulation to compact representations
  * Rapid restarts
  * ???
